'''
this file is for the constants used in the prediction model
these are generated from a geth node with globalslots set to 8000.
If you run locally, you should check to see if these are accurate using model_gas.py
you should also refit the model periodically as they may change over time.
You should have about >20k transactions in the database to fit the model accurately
